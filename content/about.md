I am a Senior Software Engineer at Google on the Android Platform team. After beginning my Google journey in 2020 as a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE), I moved to the Android Platform team early in 2021. I specialize in Android platform services, having designed, developed and launched the [TrustedTime API](https://android-developers.googleblog.com/2025/02/trustedtime-api-introducing-reliable-approach-to-time-keeping-for-apps.html), which provides accurate timestamps to over 3 billion devices. My previous work also includes high-impact contributions to the [Google/Apple Exposure Notification System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exposure_Notification), a privacy-preserving contact tracing framework that helped health authorities worldwide respond to the COVID-19 pandemic.
